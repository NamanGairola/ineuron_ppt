The spread operator helps the iterable objects to expand into individual elements.
const arr1 = ["A", "B", "C", "D"];
// Copied elements from arr1 to arr2 here
const arr2 = [...arr1];
 
// Copied elements from arr1 to arr3 here
// and also add some new elements in arr3
const arr3 = [...cars1, "E", "F"];
 
console.log(arr1);
console.log(arr2);
console.log(arr3);
